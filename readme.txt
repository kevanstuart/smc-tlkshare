====== Description ======

Please see the plugin site above for a further description of the original plugin.

====== Purpose of Adaption ======

I've adapted this plugin to fit in with a theme that I created for haimrich.com.
Adaption simplifies the options and adds a "Send to Kindle" button to the options.

====== Purpose of Rewrite in 2020 ======

I've decided to rewrite this plugin for educational purposes taking into account
my experiences at writing plugins since.

There are two plugin files in this repository:
1. Tlk_basic
2. Tlk_neat
